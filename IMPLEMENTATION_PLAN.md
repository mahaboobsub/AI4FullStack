# PHASE 0 — BLOCKERS ✅ COMPLETE

## 0.1 ✅ Bedrock model + region FIXED
**Discovered:** Claude 3.5 models are EOL/Legacy in this account.  
**Solution:** Upgraded to Claude 4 with inference profiles:
- Fast: `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4.5-20251001-v1:0`
- Reasoning: `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4.5-20251001-v1:0`
- Quality: `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- All 3 tiers tested and working

## 0.2 ✅ 3 model tiers WIRED
Using Claude Haiku 4.5 for fast+reasoning, Sonnet 4.6 for quality. Nova Lite has incompatible schema.

## 0.3 ✅ Seed data VERIFIED
- 501 donors seeded with lat/lng + phenotypes
- 50 patients seeded with antibody flags  
- `rank_donors('P-10000')` returns 8 primary donors
- Distance: 7.7-19km, antigen: 0.90-1.00

## 0.4 ✅ Bridge memberships SEEDED
- Ran `schema_v6_demo_fix.sql` in Supabase (adds patient geo + bridge tables)
- Ran `seed_bridge_memberships.py` → 20 bridges, 60 donor memberships
- Bridge bonus component now active

# PHASE 1 — PILLAR 1: SMART MATCHING ✅ COMPLETE

## 1.1 ✅ 8-Antigen ISBT scoring (DONE)
Wired into `rank_donors`: `compute_antigen_score(donor, patient)` →
`antigen_safety` weight (0.15) + hard gate (`antigen <= 0 → skip`).
Verified: safe O+ donor = 1.0, Kell-mismatch = 0.65, ABO-incompatible = 0.0 (filtered).

**E2E test ⏳ ready for Scenario A demo.**

## 1.2 ✅ Hungarian optimizer — DOCUMENTED ACCURATELY
**Decided:** Option A (honest presentation, 0 code changes).  
**Updated:** PRESENTATION.md SLIDE 7 now describes it as an **admin batch optimizer** 
(`/api/admin/optimize-assignments`) that staff trigger during surge events, with real-time 
AI conflict arbitration in the live graph. Matches actual implementation.

**Test ⏳:** `POST /api/admin/optimize-assignments` ready for Scenario E.

## 1.3 ✅ Neo4j matching — DOCUMENTED ACCURATELY  
**Updated:** PRESENTATION.md SLIDE 15 now describes Neo4j as **live chain state + visualization 
engine**, not O(1) matching. Matching uses weighted Python scoring on Supabase; Neo4j tracks 
chain state and powers force-graph dashboard. Matches actual implementation.

**Test ⏳:** Neo4j chain visualization ready for Scenario B.

## 1.4 ✅ XGBoost urgency, eligibility filter
Verified wired and working in graph pipeline.

---

# PHASE 2 — PILLAR 2: AUTONOMOUS COORDINATION ✅ VERIFIED

## 2.1 🟢 14-node LangGraph pipeline
Verified in `agents/graph.py` — entry `intake`, parallel `antigen_score ∥ urgency_score`,
conditional `route_after_neo4j_match` and `route_after_monitor`, self-loop monitor.

## 2.2 🟢 Chain auto-repair + Bolna voice (syntax fixed)
`repair.py` clsand `voice_service.py` were crashing (IndentationError) — now fixed.
Voice requires `BOLNA_API_KEY` + `BOLNA_AGENT_ID` or it returns `SKIPPED` (graceful).
`DEMO_MOCK_MODE=true` simulates a successful call for offline demos.

## 2.3 ✅ Channel routing — DOCUMENTED ACCURATELY (0 code)
**Updated:** PRESENTATION.md SLIDE 10 now describes **2-tier (Telegram → Voice)** routing. 
Matches actual planner.py implementation. SMS fallback explicitly out of scope.

## 2.4 🟢 Proactive scheduler, WebSocket, ntfy
Proactive outreach (cron 7 AM), demand forecast (cron), WebSocket broadcasts, ntfy critical
alerts — all verified wired.

**E2E test ⏳ (full coordination loop):** see Phase 5 scenario B.

---

# PHASE 3 — PILLAR 3: ENGAGEMENT (mostly 🟢)

| Feature | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Churn 4-tier batch | 🟢 | syntax fixed; cron 8 PM |
| Failure-learning loop | 🟢 | `donor_memory.analyze_response_and_update` |
| Demand forecast (5-node) | 🟢 | cron + `/api/admin/forecast/run` |
| Gamification (6 badges) | 🟢 | leaderboard live |
| SVD challenge recommender | 🟢 | `ml/challenge_recommender.py` |
| Impact story (Sonnet) | 🟢 | syntax fixed; 2-hr post-donation |
| Donor memory | 🟢 | injected into LLM calls |
| DPDP consent | 🟢 | consent gate + audit hash |

**Test ⏳:** trigger churn batch manually, confirm CRITICAL→voice / HIGH→message /
MEDIUM→challenge routing; complete a donation and confirm an impact story is generated + sent.

---

# PHASE 4 — PILLAR 4: SCALE (mostly 🟢)

| Feature | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram agentic bot | 🟢 | tool-calling, registration, /emergency |
| Bedrock multi-model | 🔴 | **fix in 0.1/0.2** |
| Amazon Textract OCR | 🟢 | + Vision-LLM fallback |
| 10-language support | 🟢 | templates + Bolna voice configs |
| SMS fallback | ⛔ | out of scope |
| LoRa offline | ⛔ | out of scope |
| Deployment | ⛔ | out of scope (run locally) |

# PHASE 5 — END-TO-END TEST SCENARIOS (frontend → backend → AI → Telegram)

> Run these only after Phase 0 is fully green. Each is a scripted demo path.

## Scenario A — Smart Matching + Antigen Safety (Pillar 1)
1. **Frontend:** open Patient Dashboard → pick a patient with anti-Kell flag.
2. **Trigger:** staff fires emergency (dashboard button or Telegram `/emergency B+ Hyderabad P-10000`).
3. **Backend:** `run_emergency_pipeline` → `intake → eligibility → antigen_score ∥ urgency → neo4j_match`.
4. **Verify:** top-8 donors are ABO-compatible AND Kell-negative ranked first; antigen_score
   visible per donor; no ABO-incompatible donor present.
5. **Frontend:** force-graph dashboard shows 8 chain nodes (position 1 = ALERTED).

**Pass criteria:** non-empty ranked list, antigen safety visibly affects order, dashboard renders chain.

## Scenario B — Autonomous Coordination + Self-Heal (Pillar 2)
1. Continue from A. First donor is ALERTED via **Telegram** (real message in donor's language).
2. **AI calling:** simulate no-response 7 min → monitor marks stale → routes to `voice` (Bolna
   call or `DEMO_MOCK_MODE` simulated) → back to monitor.
3. Simulate **decline** → `chain_repair` pulls next backup donor → re-outreach.
4. Simulate **confirm** ("YES" on Telegram) → node turns GREEN live (WebSocket) → `outcome` →
   `gamification` (badge) → END.
5. Force 3+ stale → `inventory` (blood-bank fallback) → ntfy alert to staff.

**Pass criteria:** chain never silently dies; every transition broadcasts to the dashboard.

## Scenario C — Telegram Agentic Bot (Pillar 4)
1. Donor registration flow via bot (incl. **OCR**: upload blood-card photo → Textract extracts type).
2. Language auto-detect → bot replies in detected language (Bedrock).
3. Donor asks free-text question → agentic tool-calling answers (badges, next eligible date, leaderboard).

**Pass criteria:** bot responds via Bedrock (not template fallback), OCR fills blood_type.

## Scenario D — Engagement Loop (Pillar 3)
1. Run churn batch → confirm tiered interventions dispatch.
2. Complete a donation → 2-hr impact story generated (Sonnet) + delivered on Telegram.
3. Run demand forecast → admin panel (`DemandForecastPanel.tsx`) shows 28-day chart + shortage alerts.

**Pass criteria:** churn tiers route correctly; impact story is personalized (not fallback);
forecast renders on Admin page.

## Scenario E — Conflict / Optimizer (Pillar 1 advanced)
1. Fire 2 concurrent CRITICAL requests sharing nearby donors.
2. **Option A path:** `POST /api/admin/optimize-assignments` → disjoint assignment.
3. **Option B path (if wired):** conflict node reorders chains, no double-booking.

**Pass criteria:** no donor assigned to two patients simultaneously.

# GIT HYGIENE WARNING

The remote `main` was **force-pushed** by another machine, which silently **deleted the 6
syntax fixes**. They have been restored locally from commit `22e48b5`.

**Rule for this repo until coordinated:**
- Always `git fetch` + inspect `git log origin/main` before pushing.
- After any pull, re-run `python -m compileall BloodBridge_AI_Backend/agents BloodBridge_AI_Backend/services`
  to confirm the syntax fixes survived.
- Avoid force-push. If someone force-pushes, the 6 fixes + antigen wiring must be re-applied.

---

# OUT OF SCOPE (do not spend time here)
- SMS / Twilio fallback
- LoRa offline radio bridge
- Cloud deployment (EC2/S3/Render/Vercel) — demo runs locally

# PHASE 6 — FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND CONNECTIVITY FIX ✅ COMPLETE

> All items below were identified by a full codebase audit and fixed in one pass.

## 6.1 ✅ Backend — Missing `GET /api/donors/graph/data`
**Problem:** `Graph.tsx` called `/api/donors/graph/data` but no route existed → always fell back to mock data.  
**Fix:** Added `GET /api/donors/graph/data` to `api/donors.py`. Pulls live data from `emergency_requests`,
`blood_chains`, `patients`, and `donors` tables. Supports `?request_id=all` (last 5 active requests)
or filtering by a specific `request_id`.

## 6.2 ✅ Backend — Missing `POST /api/donors/{id}/health-status`
**Problem:** `HealthStatusControl.tsx` called `/api/donors/{id}/health-status` which didn't exist → 404 on every save.  
**Fix:** Added endpoint to `api/donors.py`. Accepts `{ available, reason, hold_until, note }`.
Updates `is_active`, `medical_hold`, `medical_hold_until` on the donor; persists `note` to `donor_memory`.

## 6.3 ✅ Backend — Missing Donor Location CRUD
**Problem:** `LocationManager.tsx` on the Donor Portal called
`GET/POST/DELETE/PATCH /api/donors/{id}/locations` — none of these routes existed.  
**Fix:** Added all 4 location endpoints to `api/donors.py` mirroring the patient location pattern
(table: `donor_locations`, soft-limit: 10, geohash via `geo_service.encode_geohash`).

## 6.4 ✅ Frontend — URL Mismatch: voice + outreach triggers
**Problem:** `lib/api.ts` called `/api/donors/{id}/trigger-voice` and `/api/donors/{id}/trigger-outreach`;
backend routes are `/voice` and `/outreach` (no `trigger-` prefix) → 404 on every call.  
**Fix:** Updated `triggerVoiceCall` and `triggerOutreach` in `lib/api.ts` to use correct paths.

## 6.5 ✅ Frontend — Admin Retrain button was cosmetic
**Problem:** `handleRetrainClick()` in `Admin.tsx` ran a fake progress animation; it never called
`retrainModels()` from the API → the actual `POST /api/admin/retrain` was never fired.  
**Fix:** `handleRetrainClick` now calls `retrainModels()`, shows real `jobId` in toast, and uses
a capped animation (max 90%) that completes only after the API confirms.

## 6.6 ✅ Frontend — Admin Staff panel was hardcoded MOCK_STAFF
**Problem:** `Admin.tsx` rendered `MOCK_STAFF` (3 hardcoded entries) and the Add/Delete buttons
did nothing — real staff CRUD endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/admin/staff`) were ignored.  
**Fix:**
- Added `getStaffMembers()` and `deleteStaffMember()` to `lib/api.ts`.
- `Admin.tsx` now loads staff from the API on mount, deletes via API on trash-click,
  and has a working "Add Staff Member" dialog that calls `POST /api/admin/staff`.

## 6.7 ✅ Frontend — Donors table voice/outreach buttons were toast-only
**Problem:** Voice (📞) and Telegram (💬) buttons in the donor table called `toast("...")` —
no real API call was made.  
**Fix:** Added `handleVoiceCall(donor)` and `handleOutreach(donor)` in `Donors.tsx` that call
`triggerVoiceCall` / `triggerOutreach` from `lib/api.ts` with toast feedback on success/error.

## What is still intentionally deferred (per original scope)
- Telegram bot end-to-end tests (calling agent) — test later
- LoRa frontend panel — out of scope
- Confirm-outcome button wiring (exists in `api.ts` but no UI page calls it yet)
- DPDP consent / erasure UI — no donor-facing consent page yet
- `POST /api/patients/{id}/auto-schedule` button — no UI trigger yet
